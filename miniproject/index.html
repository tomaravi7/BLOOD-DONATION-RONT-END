            <h1 class="heading">What is Blood Donation</h1>
            <p><strong>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save the lives of others.</strong> There
                are several types
                of blood donation, which help meet different medical needs.</p>
            <p>A blood donation occurs when a person
                voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made
                into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation#:~:text=Fractionation%20is%20a%20separation%20process,varies%20according%20to%20a%20gradient."
                    target="_blank" style="color:black;">fractionation</a> (separation of
                whole-blood
                components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called
                apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that
                follow it.Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a
                community
                supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or
                friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in
                countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other
                than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use
                (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is
                inserted or may feel faint.</p>

                allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening
                includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral
                hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical
                examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can
                donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where
                the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait eight weeks (56 days)
                between whole blood donations but only seven days between plateletpheresis donations and twice per
                seven-day period in plasmapheresis.</p>

            <p> The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with automated
                equipment that takes only specific components of the blood. Most of the components of blood used for
                transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. This
                has led to some increased interest in autotransfusion, whereby a patient's blood is salvaged during
                surgery for continuous reinfusion—or alternatively, is "self-donated" prior to when it will be needed.

                <h1 class="heading">Why You Should donate</h1>
                <p>There’s no end to the benefits of donating blood for those who need it. According to the American
                    Red
                    Cross, one donation can save as many as three lives, and someone in the United States needs
                    blood every
                    two seconds.

                    It turns out that donating blood doesn’t just benefit recipients. There are health benefits for
                    donors,
                    too, on top of the benefits that come from helping others. Read on to learn the health benefits
                    of
                    donating blood and the reasons behind them.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Why it is Done</h1>
                <p>You agree to have blood drawn so that it can be given to someone who needs a blood transfusion.</p>
                <p>Millions of people need blood transfusions each year. Some may need blood during surgery. Others
                    depend
                    on it after an accident or because they have a disease that requires blood components. Blood
                    donation
                    makes all of this possible. There is no substitute for human blood — all transfusions use blood from
                    a
                    donor.</p>
                <P>There are many reasons patients need blood. A common misunderstanding about blood usage is that
                    accident victims are the patients who use the most blood. Actually, people needing the most blood
                    include those:
                <ul class="sideeffectlist">
                    <li>Being treated for cancer</li>

                    <li>Undergoing cardiovascular surgeries</li>

                        Blood donation is <b><span style="font-size: 28px;color: red;">SAFE</span></b>. New, sterile
                        disposable equipment is used for each donor, so there's no risk
                        of contracting a bloodborne infection by donating blood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're a healthy adult, you can usually donate a pint of blood without endangering your
                        health.
                        Within 24 hours of a blood donation, your body replaces the lost fluids. And after several
                        weeks,
                        your body replaces the lost red blood cells.

                    <p>
                        Donors are screened for health risks that could make the donation unsafe for the recipient. Some
                        of
                        these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from men who have sex with
                        men
                        (MSM) because of the risk of transmitting HIV. In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland)
                        reduced its blanket ban on MSM donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from
                        donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past year. A similar change was
                        made in the U.S. in late 2015 by the FDA. In 2017, the UK further reduced its restriction to
                        three months. Autologous donors are not always screened for recipient safety problems since the
                        donor is the only person who will receive the blood. Since the donated blood may be given to
                        pregnant women or women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth defect causing)
                        medications are deferred. These medications include acitretin, etretinate, isotretinoin,
                        finasteride
                        and dutasteride.

            <p>Blood donation is safe for healthy adults. There’s no risk of contracting disease. New, sterile equipment
                is used for each donor.</p>
            <p>Some people may feel nauseous, lightheaded, or dizzy after donating blood. If this happens, it should
                only last a few minutes. You can lie down with your feet up at the until you feel better.</p>
            <p>You may also experience some bleeding at the site of the needle. Applying pressure and raising your arm

                <h1 class="heading">Blood testing</h1>
                <p>The donor's blood type must be determined if the blood will be used for transfusions. The collecting
                    agency usually identifies whether the blood is type A, B, AB, or O and the donor's Rh type and
                    will screen for antibodies to less common antigens. More testing, including a crossmatch, is usually
                    done before a transfusion. Type O negative is often cited as the "universal donor" but this only
                    refers to red cell and whole blood transfusions. For plasma and platelet transfusions the system is
                    reversed: AB positive is the universal platelet donor type while both AB positive and AB negative
                    are universal plasma donor types.</p>
                <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;padding: 5px;">
                    <p>Most blood is tested for diseases, including some STDs. The tests used are high-sensitivity
                        screening tests and no actual diagnosis is made. Some of the test results are later found to be
                        false positives using more specific testing. False negatives are rare, but donors are
                        discouraged from using blood donation for the purpose of anonymous STD screening because a false
                        negative could mean a contaminated unit. The blood is usually discarded if these tests are
                        positive,
                        but there are some exceptions, such as autologous donations. The donor is generally notified of
                        the
                        test result.The WHO reported in 2006 that 56 out of 124 countries surveyed did not use these
                        basic tests on all
                        blood donations.A venipuncture is useful as it is a minimally invasive way to obtain cells and
                        extracellular fluid (plasma) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting
                        as a medium that provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the
                        excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects or is
                        affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly
                        performed medical tests.</p>

                <p>
                    Donated blood is tested by many methods, but the core tests recommended by the World Health
                    Organization are these four:
                <ul class="sideeffectlist">
                    <li>Hepatitis B Surface Antigen</li>
                    <li>Antibody to Hepatitis C</li>
                    <li>Antibody to HIV, usually subtypes 1 and 2</li>
                    <li>Serologic test for Syphilis</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>A variety of other tests for transfusion transmitted infections are often used based on local
                    requirements. Additional testing is expensive, and in some cases the tests are not implemented
                    because of the cost. These additional tests include other infectious diseases such as West Nile
                    fever, and babesiosis. Sometimes multiple tests are used for a single disease to cover the
                    limitations of each test. For example, the HIV antibody test will not detect a recently infected
                    donor, so some blood banks use a p24 antigen or HIV nucleic acid test in addition to the basic
                    antibody test to detect infected donors during that period. Cytomegalovirus is a special case in
                    donor testing in that many donors will test positive for it. The virus is not a hazard to a
                    healthy recipient, but it can harm infants and other recipients with weak immune systems.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Recovery and time between donations</h1>
            <p>Donors are usually kept at the donation site for 10–15 minutes after donating since most adverse
                reactions take place during or immediately after the donation. Blood centers typically provide light
                refreshments, such as orange juice and cookies, or a lunch allowance to help the donor recover. The
                needle site is covered with a bandage and the donor is directed to keep the bandage on for several
                hours. In hot climates, donors are advised to avoid dehydration (strenuous exercise and games,
                alcohol) until a few hours after donation.</p>
            <p>Donated plasma is replaced after 2–3 days. Red blood cells are replaced by bone marrow into the
                circulatory system at a slower rate, on average 36 days in healthy adult males. In one study, the range
                was 20 to 59 days for recovery. These replacement rates are the basis of how frequently a donor can
                donate blood.</p>
            <p>Plasmapheresis and plateletpheresis donors can donate much more frequently because they do not lose
                significant amounts of red cells. The exact rate of how often a donor can donate differs from country to
                country. For example, plasmapheresis donors in the United States are allowed to donate large volumes
                twice a week and could nominally donate 83 litres (about 22 gallons) in a year, whereas the same donor
                in Japan may only donate every other week and could only donate about 16 litres (about 4 gallons) in a
                year.</p>
            <p>Iron supplementation decreases the rates of donor deferral due to low hemoglobin, both at the first
                donation visit and at subsequent donations. Iron-supplemented donors have higher hemoglobin and iron
                stores. On the other hand, iron supplementation frequently causes diarrhea, constipation and epigastric
                abdominal discomfort. The long-term effects of iron supplementation without measurement of iron stores
                are unknown.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Storage, supply and demand</h1>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="subsubheading">Storage and blood shelf life</h2>
                <p>The collected blood is usually stored in a blood bank as separate components, and some of these have
                    short shelf lives. There are no storage methods to keep platelets for extended periods of time,
                    though some were being studied as of 2008. The longest shelf life used for platelets is seven days.
                </p>
                <p>Red blood cells (RBC), the most frequently used component, have a shelf life of 35–42 days at
                    refrigerated temperatures. For (relatively rare) long-term storage applications, this can be
                    extended by freezing the blood with a mixture of glycerol, but this process is expensive and
                    requires an extremely cold freezer for storage. Plasma can be stored frozen for an extended period
                    of time and is typically given an expiration date of one year and maintaining a supply is less of a
                    problem.</p>

                    alt="Emergency Situation" style="text-align: center;">
                <h2 class="subsubheading">Demand for blood</h2>
                <p>The limited storage time means that it is difficult to have a stockpile of blood to prepare for a
                    disaster. The subject was discussed at length after the September 11 attacks in the United States,
                    and the consensus was that collecting during a disaster was impractical and that efforts should be
                    focused on maintaining an adequate supply at all times.[91] Blood centers in the U.S. often have
                    difficulty maintaining even a three-day supply for routine transfusion demands.</p>
                <h2 class="subsubheading">Donation levels</h2>
                <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes World Blood Donor Day on 14 June each year to promote
                    blood donation. This is the birthday of Karl Landsteiner, the scientist who discovered the ABO blood
                    group system. The theme of the 2012 World Blood Donor Day campaign, "Every blood donor is a
                    hero" focuses on the idea that everyone can become a hero by giving blood. Based on data reported by
                    180 countries between 2011 and 2013, the WHO estimated that approximately 112.5 million units of
                    blood were being collected annually.</p>
                <p>In the United States it is estimated that 111 million citizens are eligible blood donors, or 37%
                    of the population. However less than 10% of the 37% eligible blood donors donate annually.
                    In the UK the NHS reports blood donation levels at "only 4%" while in Canada the rate is 3.5%.

            <h1 class="heading">Donor health benefits</h1>
            <p>In patients prone to iron overload, blood donation prevents the accumulation of toxic quantities.
                Donating blood may reduce the risk of heart disease for men, but the link has not been firmly
                established and may be from selection bias because donors are screened for health problems.</p>
            <p>Research published in 2012 demonstrated that in patients with metabolic syndrome, repeated blood donation
                is effective in reducing blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein/high-density
                lipoprotein ratio, and heart rate.</p>

            <div class="content1">
                <h1 class="heading">Donor Compensation</h1>
                <p>The World Health Organization set a goal in 1997 for all blood donations to come from unpaid
                    volunteer donors, but as of 2006, only 49 of 124 countries surveyed had established this as a
                    standard. Some countries, such as Tanzania, have made great strides in moving towards this
                    standard, with 20 percent of donors in 2005 being unpaid volunteers and 80 percent in 2007, but 68
                    of 124 countries surveyed by WHO had made little or no progress. Most plasmapheresis donors in
                    the United States and Austria and Germany are still paid for their donations. Donors are now
                    paid between $25 and $50 per donation. In some countries, for example Australia, Brazil and
                    Great Britain, it is illegal to receive any compensation, monetary or otherwise, for the donation of
                    blood or other human tissues.
                </p>
                <p>Regular donors are often given some sort of non-monetary recognition. Time off from work is a common
                    benefit. For example, in Italy, blood donors receive the donation day as a paid holiday from
                    work. Blood centers will also sometimes add incentives such as assurances that donors would
                    have priority during shortages, free T-shirts, first aid kits, windshield scrapers, pens, and
                    similar trinkets. There are also incentives for the people who recruit potential donors, such as
                    prize drawings for donors and rewards for organizers of successful drives. Recognition of
                    dedicated donors is common. For example, the Singapore Red Cross Society presents awards for
                    voluntary donors who have made a certain number of donations under the Blood Donor Recruitment
                    Programme starting with a "bronze award" for 25 donations. The government of Malaysia also
                    offers free outpatient and hospitalization benefits for blood donors, for example, 4 months of free
                    outpatient treatment and hospitalization benefits after every donation. In Poland, after
                    donating a specific amount of blood (18 litres for men and 15 for women), a person is gifted with
                    the title of "Distinguished Honorary Blood Donor" as well as a medal. In addition, a popular
                    privilege in larger Polish cities is the right to free use of public transport, but the conditions
                    for obtaining a privilege may vary depending on the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most allogeneic blood donors donate as an act of charity and do not expect to receive any direct
                    benefit from the donation. The sociologist Richard Titmuss, in his 1970 book The Gift
                    Relationship: From Human Blood to Social Policy, compared the merits of the commercial and
                    non-commercial blood donation systems of the US and the UK, coming down in favor of the latter. The
                    book became a bestseller in the US, resulting in legislation to regulate the private market in
                    blood. The book is still referenced in modern debates about turning blood into a
                    commodity. The book was republished in 1997 and the same ideas and principles are applied to
                    analogous donation programs, such as organ donation and sperm donation.
