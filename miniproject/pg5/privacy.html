            <p style="font-size: 18px;font-family: sans-serif;">We believe that health information should be free to
                everyone and we rely on advertising to make this possible. Providing the best health information in the
                world is expensive. We spend up to thousands of dollars per article to ensure it is accurate and precise
                with quality review by a doctor or other certified, trained medical professional.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;font-family: sans-serif;">When you visit our website, we use cookies and similar
                tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience, store or access relevant information,

                If you do not allow “Ad Selection, Delivery, and Reporting” below, then you still will see advertising,
                but the ads may be less relevant and interesting to you.</p>
